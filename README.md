# **write_imports Tool**

**write_imports Tool** is a helper for creating "import" lines in **Python**. It searches all directories and subdirectories to find **Python** files. Once found, the tool's script identifies all functions and classes in these files, but it skips any functions that start with an underscore. Additionally, there's a **Jupyter notebook** that demonstrates how to use this tool.

## How to Use:
- Begin by opening the provided **main.ipynb** **Jupyter notebook**.
- In the very first cell, clone the repository using the code:
```
YOUR_CLONING_COMMAND_HERE
```
- After completing the cloning process, proceed to execute all the cells in the notebook.
- This will run the tool and you'll be able to see how it works with your program, generating the required "import" lines.
