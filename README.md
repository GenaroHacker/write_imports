## Auto generate Python import lines for your project.
`write_imports` is a tool for printing "import" lines in Python. It searches all directories and subdirectories to find Python files. Once found, the tool's script identifies all functions and classes in these files. However, it skips any functions that start with an underscore and any specified directories.

Additionally, there's a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use this tool.

## How to Use:
- Begin by opening the provided **main.ipynb** **Jupyter notebook**.
- Clone your repository using the code  `!git clone YOUR_REPO_LINK_GOES_HERE` in the first cell.
- Then execute all the cells in the notebook.
- This will run the tool and you'll be able to see how it works with your program, generating the required "import" lines.
