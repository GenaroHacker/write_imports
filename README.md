# The write_imports Tool

The write_imports Tool is a helper for creating "import" lines in Python. It searches all directories and subdirectories to find Python files. Once found, the tool's script identifies all functions and classes in these files, but it skips any functions that start with an underscore. Additionally, there's a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use this tool.

## Instructions

1. Begin by opening the provided main.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
2. In the very first cell, clone the repository.
3. After completing the cloning process, proceed to execute all the cells in the notebook.
4. This will run the tool and you'll be able to see how it works with your program, generating the required "import" lines.
